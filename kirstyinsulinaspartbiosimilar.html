Biosimilars for biologic drugs are equivalent to generics for small molecule drugs. Unlike generics, biosimilars may be slightly different in molecular structure to the original branded drug, hence they cannot be called generic. Even if slightly different, biosimilars are proven to have similar efficacy and clinical outcomes to their branded equivalents through biosimilar equivalency clinical trials. Recombinant human insulin is used in the management of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is no longer produced by patients while in type 2 diabetes, insulin production is insufficient for glucose breakdown. External insulin delivery recovers low endogenous insulin level to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.</p><p><br><a href='#moa' id='moa'>Mechanism of Action</a></p><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_aspart'>Insulin aspart</a> is different from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin'>human insulin</a>, with a single amino acid change at the B28 position, from proline to aspartic acid. Insulin aspart has more rapid onset and shorter duration of activity than normal human insulin, and may be combined with longer-acting NPH (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPH_insulin'>neutral protamine Hagedorn</a>) insulin to control blood sugar levels over longer time periods. Insulin aspart injection at concentration 100 units/mL is a clear and colorless solution. It is available as 10 mL multiple-dose vials, and 3 mL single-patient-use prefilled pens.</p><p><br><a href='#pricing' id='pricing'>Pricing and availability</a></p><p>Kirsty was approved by the <a href='https://www.fda.gov'>Food & Drug Administration (FDA)</a> in July 2025 after President Biden passed the <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text'>Inflation Reduction Act</a> in 2024, which capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35. Kirsty is available for $80 per 10mL vial (1000 units), sufficient for 1 month for most patients. Kirsty copay support is available from Biocon Biologics, the drug's marketer, capping out-of-pocket patient costs at $35 per month.</p><p><a href='https://www.bioconbiologicsus.com/'>Biocon Biologics</a> manufactures and markets insulin aspart-xjhz or Kirsty. It is a subsidiary of the Indian company Biocon which primarily manufactures biosimilars of branded drugs. After the <a href='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/homepage'>European Medicines Agency (EMA)</a> approved Kixelle (later renamed Kirsty) in February 2021, a wave of insulin aspart biosimilars hit the EU, Canadian and Australian markets. The US FDA was last to approve an insulin aspart biosimilar in February 2025.</p><p><br><a href='#access' id='access'>Patient accessibility</a></p><p>Insulin costs $2-4 per vial to make. From an average cost of $56 per month in 2004, the price of insulin steadily increased to a peak of $273 in 2023 before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2024. After IRA, the average price of insulin is now $66, translating to massively improved patient access. Original insulin, produced from purified animal pancreas extract, was first administered in 1922 by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Banting'>Frederick Banting</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Best_(medical_scientist)'>Charles Best</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Collip'>James Collip</a>. Recombinant insulin was the first drug produced in bacteria by <a href='https://www.gene.com/'>Genentech</a> in 1978, licensed to <a href='https://www.lilly.com/'>Eli Lilly</a> and <a href='https://www.gene.com/stories/cloning-insulin'>approved in 1982</a>. A drug continuously in production for over 100 years under different methods was unaffordable for many patients till last year. Insulin aspart is a slightly modified version of insulin that functions the same as human insulin.</p><p>In 2025, the state of California announced <a href='https://calrx.ca.gov/'>CalRx insulin</a> priced at $11 per pen, produced in a collaboration between Civica Rx and Biocon Biologics, the drug maker behind Kirsty. This announcement states that the state of California will manufacture and sell insulin glargine, a long-acting insulin, under the CalRx label with a capped price of $11 per pen. It will be available for state pharmacies in California to purchase at $45 per 5-pack or $9 per pen and sell at $11 per pen.</p><p>Insulin is one of the most widely used drugs in the world, given that 830 million people lived with diabetes in 2022. Insulin accessibility has been a topic of debate between lawmakers, drug makers, insurers and doctors. Insurance coverage for insulin is high but Insulin's high out-of-pocket costs for uninsured or underinsured patients, $273 in 2023, have been a significant barrier to accessibility. With the passage of IRA and increased availability of biosimilars like Kirsty and CalRx, insulin accessibility is finally being tackled from both political and commercial ends.</p><p><br><a href='#ref' id='ref'>References:</a></p><p>[1]: Food & Drug Administration.
