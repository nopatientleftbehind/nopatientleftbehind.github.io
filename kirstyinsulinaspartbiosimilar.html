Diabetes is primarily of 2 types: type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is no longer produced by patients while in type 2 diabetes, insulin production is insufficient for glucose breakdown. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin injections in all cases while type 2 diabetes requires insulin injections in a majority of cases. Unfortunately, access to insulin was historically limited from low yield production methods. Insulin production with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA'>recombinant DNA technology</a> since 1978 greatly improved yields but access is now limited by high costs to patients. Kirsty and CalRx are 2 insulin biosimilars to improve access to insulin by lowering patient costs.</p><p>Biosimilars for biologic drugs are equivalent to generics for small molecule drugs. Unlike generics, biosimilars may be slightly different in molecular structure to the original branded drug, hence they cannot be called generic. Even if slightly different, biosimilars are proven to have similar efficacy and clinical outcomes to their branded equivalents through biosimilar equivalency clinical trials.</p><p>Insulin aspart-xjhz, brand name <a href='https://www.kirsty.com/'>Kirsty</a>, is a biosimilar drug of <a href='https://www.novolog.com/'>Novolog</a> insulin. Insulin glargine, brand name CalRx, is a biosimilar of long-acting insulin <a href='https://www.lantus.com/'>Lantus</a>. Both insulin aspart and insulin glargine are approved by the FDA for management of diabetes mellitus. External insulin delivery recovers low endogenous insulin level to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.</p><p><br><a href='#moa' id='moa'>Mechanism of Action</a></p><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_aspart'>Insulin aspart</a> is different from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin'>human insulin</a>, with a single amino acid change at the 28th position of the B-chain, from proline to aspartic acid. Insulin aspart has more rapid onset and shorter duration of activity than normal human insulin, and may be combined with longer-acting NPH (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPH_insulin'>neutral protamine Hagedorn</a>) insulin to control blood sugar levels over longer time periods. Insulin aspart injection at concentration 100 units/mL is a clear and colorless solution. It is available as 10 mL multiple-dose vials, and 3 mL single-patient-use prefilled pens.</p><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_glargine'>Insulin glargine</a> is different from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin'>human insulin</a> in 2 places: first, an amino acid change in position 21 of the A-chain, from asparagine to glycine; second, the B-chain carboxy-terminal end is extended by 2 amino acid residues of arginine. Insulin glargine has longer duration of activity than normal human insulin to control blood sugar levels over longer time periods. This is because the extra arginine amino acids shift the isoelectric point from pH 5.4 to pH 6.7. This makes insulin glargine less soluble at the body's pH (physiological pH), forming higher-order aggregates at the site of injection, resulting in a slow, peakless dissolution and absorption of insulin. Insulin glargine injection available at concentration 100 units/mL is a clear and colorless solution. Insulin glargine, Lantus branded insulin and CalRx biosimilar insulin are available as 3 mL single-patient-use prefilled pens.</p><p><br><a href='#pricing' id='pricing'>Pricing and availability</a></p><p>Kirsty was approved by the <a href='https://www.fda.gov'>Food & Drug Administration (FDA)</a> in July 2025 after President Biden passed the <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text'>Inflation Reduction Act</a> in 2024, which capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35. Kirsty is available for $80 per 10mL vial (1000 units), sufficient for 1 month for most patients. Kirsty copay support is available from Biocon Biologics, the drug's marketer, capping out-of-pocket patient costs at $35 per month.</p><p><a href='https://www.bioconbiologicsus.com/'>Biocon Biologics</a> manufactures and markets insulin aspart-xjhz or Kirsty. It is a subsidiary of the Indian company Biocon which primarily manufactures biosimilars of branded drugs. After the <a href='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/homepage'>European Medicines Agency (EMA)</a> approved Kixelle (later renamed Kirsty) in February 2021, a wave of insulin aspart biosimilars hit the EU, Canadian and Australian markets. The US FDA was last to approve an insulin aspart biosimilar in February 2025.</p><p>CalRx insulin is a <a href='https://calrx.ca.gov/biosimilar-insulin-initiative/'>biosimilar insulin initiative</a> by the government of California to manufacture and provide low-cost insulin in California. CalRx insulin is manufactured and marketed by Biocon Biologics and <a href='https://civicarx.org/'>Civica Rx</a>. Civica Rx is a nonprofit generic and biosimilar drug marketer that markets white-labeled drugs. A 5-pack of CalRx insulin prefilled pens is available for $55, or $11 per pen. It is also available wholesale at $9 per pen. The average retail price of 5-pack Lantus insulin before the $35 hard limit set by the Inflation Reduction Act (2024) was $229 without insurance.</p><p><br><a href='#access' id='access'>Patient accessibility</a></p><p><a href='https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/the-price-of-insulin-a-qanda-with-kasia-lipska/'>According to this article from Yale School of Medicine</a>, insulin costs $2-4 per vial to make. In 2004, insulin retailed for an average price of $56 per month. The price of insulin steadily increased to a peak of $273 per month in 2023 before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2024. The IRA capped the out-of-pocket monthly cost for insulin at $35, meaning $35 is the maximum a patient will pay for insulin regardless of insurance. After IRA, the average price of insulin is now $66 per month, translating to massively improved patient access. This improved insulin access is the culmination of decades-long patient advocacy by patients, doctors and lawmakers.</p><p>Original insulin, produced from purified animal pancreas extract, was first administered in 1922 by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Banting'>Frederick Banting</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Best_(medical_scientist)'>Charles Best</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Collip'>James Collip</a>. Recombinant insulin was the first drug produced in bacteria by <a href='https://www.gene.com/'>Genentech</a> in 1978, licensed to <a href='https://www.lilly.com/'>Eli Lilly</a> and <a href='https://www.gene.com/stories/cloning-insulin'>approved in 1982</a>. A drug continuously in production for over 100 years under different methods was unaffordable for many patients till last year. Insulin aspart and insulin glargine are slightly modified versions of human insulin with different durations of action. Biosimilar availability of both helped decrease insulin's price to improve patient access.</p><p>In 2025, the state of California announced <a href='https://calrx.ca.gov/'>CalRx insulin</a> priced at $11 per pen, produced in a collaboration between Civica Rx and Biocon Biologics, the drug maker behind Kirsty. This announcement states that the state of California will manufacture and sell insulin glargine, a long-acting insulin, under the CalRx label with a capped price of $11 per pen. It will be available for state pharmacies in California to procure at $45 per 5-pack or $9 per pen.</p><p>Insulin is one of the most widely used drugs in the world, given that 830 million people worldwide live with diabetes (2022). Insulin accessibility has been a topic of debate between lawmakers, drug makers, insurers and doctors. Insurance coverage for insulin is high but insulin's high out-of-pocket cost for uninsured or underinsured patients, $273 in 2023, has been a significant barrier to accessibility. With the passage of IRA and increased availability of biosimilars like Kirsty and CalRx, insulin accessibility is finally being tackled from both political and commercial ends.</p><p><br><a href='#ref' id='ref'>References:</a></p><p>[1]: Food & Drug Administration.
